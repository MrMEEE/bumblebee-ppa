If a file has a .in equivalent, do not modify the generated files directly.
Instead, modify the .in files and use the below commands to generate the
regular files:

    cd nvidia-graphics-drivers-VERSION
    make -f debian/rules regen-from-templates

Multiarch support is available since Natty, but is actually implemented on
oneiric. Do not try to implement it on Natty and before, it'll break Intel
GL. (https://github.com/MrMEEE/bumblebee/issues/493)

Maverick-specific notes:
dh-modaliases is provided by the jockey source package in Natty an newer. Older
releases do not have the dh_modaliases program, therefore we've two choices:

 1. Provide dh-modaliases
 2. Use the old behavior
(1) could break other packages which supply a dh-modaliases program too, so
let's use the "why break something that aint broken" rule and use the old
behavior.

nvidia-current-modaliases was replaced by dh-modaliases which searches the
control files for aliases in Natty, see the below commit link:
