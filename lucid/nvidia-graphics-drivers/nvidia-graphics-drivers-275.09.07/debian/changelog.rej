+    - GeForce GT 540M
+  * Fixed memory error and abort reported by glibc when running the 
+    application FieldView from Intelligent Light.
+  * Fixed an OpenGL driver bug that caused an application crash when 
+    running Altair HyperMesh.
+  * Fixed a performance problem when switching between stereo and 
+    monoscopic rendering in the application Smoke.
+  * Fixed poor X driver handling of pixmap out of memory scenarios.
+  * Fixed an interrupt handling deficiency that could lead to performance 
+    and stability problems when many NVIDIA GPUs shared few IRQs.
+  * Fixed bugs in the VDPAU presentation queue that could cause GPU 
+    errors and hangs when destroying a presentation queue. This happens 
+    when exiting applications, and also when toggling to and from 
+    full-screen mode in Adobe Flash.
