Description: NVIDIA binary Xorg driver, kernel module and VDPAU library
 The binary driver provide optimized hardware acceleration of OpenGL
 applications via a direct-rendering X Server. AGP, PCIe, SLI, TV-out
 and flat panel displays are also supported.
 .
 This package also includes the source for building the kernel module
 required by the Xorg driver, and provides NVIDIA's implementation of
 the Video Decode and presentation API. The latter enables acceleration
 for GeForce 8 and later series cards for h264 video.
 .
 GPUs such as GeForce series 6 or newer are supported.
 .
 See /usr/share/doc/#DRIVERNAME#/README.txt.gz for a complete list 
 of supported GPUs and PCIIDs
